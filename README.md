# COMP1004-Project-DiceBlade
**This is my game project for the COMP1004 module - Dice Blade**

## Project Scope
The main scope of this project is to create a game that would entertain the user in order to see what enriches leisure time which would be playing a game. This game aims to do a unique take on the turn-based RPG category centered around one thing: **Dice!**

## Project Vision
In this project, I will be exploring leisure time and what might enrich
this through developing a game. Developing this project will provide me
with a wide range of knowledge and experience as I will be improving my
game development skills further. During my A Level Computer Science
2019/2021 I was assigned a task to produce a game as my NEA project
which gave me a foundation to game development using Unity. In this
project, I will use my experience and this time I will be developing a
game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is an unfamiliar but new
environment I will be touching upon but that is why undertaking this
project is important to me.
My main vision for this project is to create an enjoyable and
worthwhile game in order to encourage the user to spend their leisure
time with good quality which will provide them a good experience which
is what a good game should deliver. In order to achieve this, I have
thoughtfully written out different ideas, including common and existing
game concepts and adding a bit more to them or a gimmick which will
make it unique. This is because developing a game of a concept that
already exists may not be worthwhile to the user as they could just
play another game of the same genre but better developed. By adding
extra flair to it or combining two different concepts to make them
unique, I am providing something quite new to the user.

## Unfortunate Circumstances with the Project
There is currently a fatal bug that causes the cutscenes in the game to not fire, therefore features such as text messages, NPC interaction **(Which unfortunately includes the battle system)** have not been implemented, this is noted in my Project Report.
